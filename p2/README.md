## Game planning
* Define winner variable as null
* Player 1 randomly chooses either rock, paper, or scissors
    * Define array of moves: rock, paper, and scissors
    * Extract P1 move using rand function to choose key: 0, 1, or 2
    * Repeat for P2 
* Create chained if-elseif statements and printing winners/tie
    * If P1 move is equal to P2, then there is a tie
    * If P1 is `Rock`and P2 is `scissors`, then P1 wins 
    * If P1 is `Rock` and P2 is `paper`, then P2 wins 
    * If P1`Paper` and P2 is `rock`, then P1 wins 
    * If P1`Paper` and P2 is `scissors`, then P2 wins 
    * If P1 is `Scissors` and P2 is `paper`, then P1 wins 
    * If P1 is `Scissors` and P2 is `rock`, then P2 wins 
    * Declare a winner or a tie.
