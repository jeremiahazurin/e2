    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a non-traditional, distance student from Washington, DC. Prior to college, I took time off to backpack and cycle overseas but returned to school to earn my bachelor’s degree remotely. I consequently spend each semester traveling as a “digital nomad” and have worked in Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Thailand, the Vatican, Peru, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Pittsburgh. After graduation, I’ll be joining the Foreign Service with the US Department of State.
