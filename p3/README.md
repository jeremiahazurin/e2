* Define winner variable as null
* Player (P1) selects either rock, paper, or scissors
    * Assign items (value) to items: rock, paper, and scissors in HTML (index)
    * Add `submit` button
    * Define winner (correct)    
* Create chained if-elseif statements and printing winners/tie (process)
    * If P1 move is equal to P2, then there is a tie
    * If P1 is `Rock`and P2 is `scissors`, then P1 wins 
    * If P1 is `Rock` and P2 is `paper`, then P2 wins 
    * If P1`Paper` and P2 is `rock`, then P1 wins 
    * If P1`Paper` and P2 is `scissors`, then P2 wins 
    * If P1 is `Scissors` and P2 is `paper`, then P1 wins 
    * If P1 is `Scissors` and P2 is `rock`, then P2 wins 
    * Declare a winner or a tie (redirect p1 to index)
        * Add header and session 
        * Add if-else display logic
        * Add isset to show result
